## KISS army!

Well, _Keep It Simple, Stupid_

After years of neglecting any primary online presence, I decided I wanted to get a blog up and running (or wheezing, we'll see). Since I use [CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) at work, I figured I'd build a site with that.

Yeah! It'll be __great__! After weeks and weeks of learning the Cake ACL Auth/Az system, installing, configuring, customizing, and ultimately replacing plugin after plugin, it occured to me that I was no closer to a functional site.

## Achievement unlocked! Insight gained!

Scrap the idea of a fully-functional CMS. Admit that I don't need all the bells and whistles for what is likely to be a deserted street corner where I can unleash my moderately coherent screeds to a cold and uncaring world.

Catharsis doesn't require a lot of infrastructure. Self-expression doesn't *require* top-tier widgets and gold-plated gears. So hello there, [GitHub](http://www.github.com). I see you have a system set up for simple blogging.

## Source Code Control as publisher

GitHub has some wonderful tools in the GitHub Pages offering. Specifically, they will host the pages for you! Granted, everthing is static HTML (although you can fancy things up with Javascript and suchlike), but it automatically publishes your content when you commit it to your repository!

Even better, it runs your repository through [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) before publishing, so you can write everything in Markdown, and it'll get converted to HTML automagically! Plus, it has enough flexibility to build themes for your site via includes courtesy of [Liquid](http://wiki.shopify.com/Liquid).

## This isn't [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves)...

No overhanging learning cliff here. There's still things for me to pick up, but once I get comfortable with Markdown, I should be able to crank out content with greater ease. Some time with Liquid should put me on track for tweaking my theme. And tracking down providers for various services may take some time (I'm using [IntenseDebate](http://www.intensedebate.com) as my comments service, just because I'm a rebel and don't want to use Disqus.)

So settle in, let the world generate, and hopefully this won't end in a pool of magma and vomit...
