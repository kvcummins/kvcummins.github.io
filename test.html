spellname: "Nintoq's Bells of the Sepulchre"
description: "The spellcaster creates special bells that can bind the spirits of the dead, and compel answers from them."
text: "The spellcaster creates one to four small bells, the clappers for each being crafted from a bone from the corpse of the spirit being bound. Each bell beyond the first results in a -1 modifier to the spellcheck roll for the binding. These clappers must also be encrusted with gold and/or gems worth at least 100gp each. The rituals of binding require a day per bell, along with a Spellburn of CL per bell. Once the ritual has succeeded, no additional bells may be bound to the spirit by the spellcaster."
