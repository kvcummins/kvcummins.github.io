### The River Gate

{:style="margin-left:1em; float:right;"}

On the edge of the Naerac Deeps, there lies an ancient ruin forgotten in time and protected by legend and beast.
The Deeps are a dangerous place, and the wolves, giant spiders, and other creatures that feed and feast on human flesh are even more common around the remains of this once great walled city.
The ruins extend all the way to the Rhymewand on the South, and the **River Gate** is the most accessible part of the crumbling walls.

The bridge across the Rhymwand is still standing, and relatively sturdy. The river here is still in its infancy, and the bridge construction is quite simple. Just on the South shore is the ruins of what was once perhaps a customs house or guard barracks.
Across the waters, the unmistakable shapes of the River Gate extend from the Deeps to the river's edge, like the tentative hand of a child, reaching for an unwatched treat.
But the years have not been kind to this entrance. Only one gate tower stands complete for more than a story or two, and the western tower has almost completely collapsed. Only a portion connected to the main wall remains.
Other structures are recognizable; a round tower can be seen poking up, and some small structures seem to have collapsed near the wall.

While the bridge is structurally sound, it does provide a bottleneck that savvy hunters use to ambush their prey from the ruined buildings. There is a nearby fallen tree that has exposed an entrance to a den for _something_.

### The Hunter's Hole
{:style="clear: both;"}

When approached from the west, there is a small bluff that has a narrow path leading up to what looks like the remains of a fortified entrance carved directly into the face of the bluff. 
Called the **Hunter's Hole** by the few souls who have seen it, it is believed to have been a sally port for huntsmen, messengers, etc. who may have needed a quieter way out of the city.
Rocks and small boulders are strewn about the foot of the bluff, and there is little growth to hide an approaching interloper.
Among the trees at edge of the bluff, remnants of towers and a wall can be seen.

No one who has ever entered the Hunter's Hole has ever returned. One can only imagine the horrors that must lay within that dark underground passage.
