### The River Gate

On the edge of the Naerac Deeps, there lies an ancient ruin forgotten in time and protected by legend and beast.
The Deeps are a dangerous place, and the wolves, giant spiders, and other creatures that feed and feast on human flesh are even more common around the remains of this once great walled city.
The ruins extend all the way to the Rhymewand on the South, and the River Gate is the most accessible part of the crumbling walls.

The bridge across the Rhymwand is still standing, and relatively sturdy. Since the river is still fairly small, and the construction quite simple. Just on the South shore is the ruins of what was once perhaps a customs house or guard barracks.
Across the waters, the unmistakable shapes of the River Gate extend from the Deeps to the river's edge, like the tentative hand of a child, reaching for unwatched treat.
But the years have not been kind to this entrance. Only one gate tower stands complete for more than a story or two, and the western tower has almost completely collapsed. Only a portion connected to the main wall remains.
Other structures are recognizable; a round tower can be seen poking up, and some small structures seem to have collapsed near the wall.

While the bridge is structurally sound, it does provide a bottleneck that savvy hunters use to ambush their prey from the ruined buildings. There is a nearby fallen tree that has exposed an entrance to a den for _something_.
