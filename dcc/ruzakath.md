### Ancient roots

![Plan View][plan]{:class="img-thumbnail" title="Plan View" style="margin-left:1em;float:right;"}

Ruzakath is something of a mystery. As the kingdom expanded, the stark and ascetic mountain fortress was found abandoned, but in decent shape. 
It perches on the cliffside of a mesa that sits along a narrow road that leads back into the mountains, where explorers found signs of copper and iron that would eventually become the Waspbride Mines.
After a year of repairs and upgrades, it was formally made a Baronial seat, with a fief that contained both the newly found Waspbride mines, and the rich timberland of the Naerac Forests.
Every Baron who has held this mostly ceremonial position has made some discovery of passages or rooms hitherto unknown. Baron Remaklus has taken to simply sealing up any new finds, rather than expanding the keep.
There has been talk that some of these finds refuse to remain sealed, but that's likely the talk of bored masons and lazy guards.

### Modernizations and upgrades

While little changed on the outside, there were many changes made to the interior of the fortress.
The visible exterior is quite modest in size, with two towers and a wall surrounding a courtyard that could hold perhaps a dozen mounted horsemen. 
Above the courtyard are a trio of cupolas that provide cover for the entire area. One of the towers, and the cupolas are only accessible from inside the fortress, making them even less vulnerable.
Rather than struggle with bringing bulk goods and pack animals through the main passageways, a lift tunnel was dug from the open keep down to the storerooms below, and a fortified structure built around it. 
This lift is a massive piece of modern machinery, and can transport whole wagons, with horses.
Also installed on the exterior are a pair of ballistas, one in each tower, which cover the exposed road up to the entrance. 

With less traffic through the main halls, some effort was made to beautify the space. Artisans were brought in to smooth the walls, and lay decorative floorings. 
Most of the previous wall carvings were destroyed to make space for more contemporary decoration, although some of the crude depictions of what may have been grand battles and legends can still be found in out-of-the-way areas.

Directly below the courtyard are the storerooms and workshops. All of the living quarters and administrative areas are beyond the cliff face, either buried deep in the rock, or open to the sky from the top of the mesa. 
Also open to the sky are corrals and small plots of land, where the inhabitants can raise livestock and grow a variety of vegetables and herbs. Every room or area that is open to the outdoors is also heavily reinforced, providing a defence against any airborne threat.

### Honoured or dismissed?

Lord Remaklus was stationed at Ruzakath nearly 14 years ago, charged with protecting the route to the once-valuable mines deep within the Waspbride Peaks.
For nearly a decade, this was an assignment worthy of great honor. The minerals coming out of the mines was essential to the War of the Fire Oaks. 
But with the grand, bitter-sweet victory at Roostnip Dale 5 years ago and the acquisition of the vast mines under Thaes Mountain, the Waspbride mines became unnecessary. 
Lord Remaklus was never recalled, never reassigned, in fact he was never even contacted by the crown prince after his ascension to the throne.

Over the past few years, he has come to believe that he has been completely forgotten, guarding an unneeded hole in the ground. His loyal zeal turned to violent, draconian rule. 
The anger he felt simmered down to a sharp, painful ball of depression and self-doubt.
The fortress has succumbed to a malaise that lays upon the land like a rain-soaked blanket. Discipline is lax, and leadership is vague. 
There has even been rumours that some of the guard have been working with bandits and smugglers to squeeze what valuables they can from the skeleton crew left maintaining the mines.
