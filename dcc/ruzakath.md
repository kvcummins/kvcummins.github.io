### Ancient roots

Ruzakath is something of a mystery. As the kingdom expanded, the stark and ascetic mountain fortress was found abandoned, but in decent repair. 
After a year of repairs and upgrades, it was formally made a Baronial seat, with a fief that contained both the newly found Waspbride mines, and the rich timberland of the Naerac Forests.
Every Baron who has held this mostly ceremonial position has made some discovery of passages or rooms hitherto unknown. Baron Remaklus has taken to simply sealing up any new finds, rather than expanding the keep.
There has been talk that some of these finds refuse to remain sealed, but that's likely the talk of bored masons and lazy guards.


### Honored or dismissed?

Lord Remaklus was stationed at Ruzakath nearly 14 years ago, charged with protecting the route to the once-valuable mines deep within the Waspbride Peaks.
For nearly a decade, this was an assignment worthy of great honor. The minerals coming out of the mines was essential to the War of the Fire Oaks. 
But with the grand, bitter-sweet victory at Roostnip Dale 5 years ago and the acquisition of the vast mines under Thaes Mountain, the Waspbride mines became unnecessary. 
Lord Remaklus was never recalled, never reassigned, in fact he was never even contacted by the crown prince after his ascension to the throne.


Over the past few years, he has come to believe that he has been completely forgotten, guarding an unneeded hole in the ground. His loyal zeal turned to violent, draconian rule. 
The anger he felt simmered down to a sharp, painful ball of depression and self-doubt.
The fortress has succumbed to a malaise that lays upon the land like a rain-soaked blanket. Discipline is lax, and leadership is vague. 
There has even been rumours that some of the guard have been working with bandits and smugglers to squeeze what valuables they can from the skeleton crew left maintaining the mines.
