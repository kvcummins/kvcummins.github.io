### And lo, there was a vast expanse of blankness

I want to create a world for me to take my kids into using [DCC][] (or maybe [FATE][]).
Based on that, I know it's going to be a [low-fantasy setting][1]. Very much a [Conan][] or [Lankhmar][] setting. In fact, I may not let them use magic at all.

I'm going to use the hex creation system from [The Welsh Piper][], and create a small area for them to start in. If they explore beyond what I've created, I should be able to easily expand their territory.

Some quick searching, and I think I'll be using [Chaotic Shiny][] for generating a fair amount of generic content for the area. Who knows, maybe it'll spark a major arc? 
And for NPCs, I'll be using my [Character Cards][] that I got via a [Kickstarter][] project.

### The GM moved upon the blankness, and brought forth the terrain and features

So, using the method from [The Welsh Piper][], I'm going to start with a sub-arctic climate. 
I'm going to override the tables for this first atlas hex, and place a few things arbitrarily. I'm thinking a fortress somewhere, a ruin, and maybe a lair or bandit camp.

#### A brief interlude for creation

OK, a little work with the templates from [The Welsh Piper][] and [Hexographer][] gives me a map!

![Hex Map][hmap]{:style="margin-left:1em; float:right;"}
Here is the resulting atlas hex, with sub hexes. Each sub hex is 5 miles across. The village **Aret**, in hex 608, is where the PCs will start their adventure! 
It is a small village of hunters, trappers, and sustenance farmers. Not much occurs there that impacts anyone outside of the village. 
They eke out a living trading with the occasional merchant who might make the side trip from the nearby fortress.

The fortress **Ruzakath** in 305 is the keep of **Emile Remaklus**, the minor noble currently tasked with keeping an eye on the **Bridewasp Peaks** to the southeast and the **Naerac Forests** to the east.

The mysterious monolith in 408, the **Pillar of Relgo**, is believed to be haunted, and everyone gives it a wide berth.

To the northeast in 704, along the edges of the Deep Naerac, are some old ruins. No one is sure how extensive they are, as the area is infested with wolves and supposedly worse. 
Some brave adventurers have attempted to plumb the depths of these ancient, crumbling structures, but they always returned bloodied and empty-handed. When they returned at all.

Running out of the Bridewasp is the **Rhymewand River** not terribly impressive yet, this river flows down through the Naeracs and out into the arid plains beyond. 
It's not so well known in this area, but the Rhymewand becomes a large river as it nears the sea, attracting merchants and pirates alike.

The remainder of the setting will have to remain in my notes, at least until my players experience it.
