### Relgo the Impatient

Relgo was an impressive spell caster. His spells all seemed to be custom-made to impress and wow any onlookers. There was always flames, or smoke, or some _magical_ effect for the crowd.

That being said, his spells weren't always the most effective. Other wizards who knew him were never impressed by his skills, and thought of him as a charlatan and a huckster. Nothing more than a hedge-wizard playing on the fears and hopes of the locals.

Relgo didn't think that, not at all. He always saw himself as a powerful wielder of the arcane, beset upon all sides by jealous and petty rivals. All his failures, and all his failures in judgment he blamed on other wizards, or on those who wished to see him fall from magnificence.

He came up with the brilliant idea that he was going to get away from his detractors by simply outliving them. He began studying ancient texts, and searching the lands for any hint of a way to become immortal. His searches led him to libraries both humble and opulent. It was in a well-hidden library that he met [Nintoq the Inquisitive][], and beseeched the great librarian to aid him in his research.

Relgo's research moved at a much faster pace, even as he performed tasks for his bespectacled patron. Inevitably, he found the lost tomes of a great necromancer, and was able to glean the secrets of controlling not only the dead, by Death itself! Giddy with this newfound lore, Relgo retreated to what is now the Naerac Forests to prepare himself. He built a crypt for himself, and underneath that, an underground complex that would serve as his laboratory, his refuge, his seat of power for the centuries. Atop his crypt, he raised a grand monolith, hollowed out to provide a perch from which to survey his realm, and to look down upon the mortals as they went about their trivial lives.

Determined not to run afoul of his meddling competitors, he studied in solitude, raising a small army of skeletons and zombies; learning the ways of the necromancer. When he felt he was ready, he sealed himself in his crypt and began his spells.

But Relgo made a mistake. In his haste, the spell he had crafted from the musty books granted not eternal immunity to death, but eternal immunity to decay. Seeing as part of the ritual he had concocted included a heavy dose of poison, Relgo never left the crypt.

### The Preservations

Relgo may have been an imperfect wizard, but he was a powerful one. Everything in the vicinity of the crypt became immune to decay. The resulting collapse of the ecosystem has left the lands around the crypt unable to sustain any plant life, and the only thing that seems to thrive are lichens, slime molds, and a few hardy mosses.
