    text: |
      The spellcaster creates one to four small bells, the clappers for each being crafted from a bone from the corpse of the spirit being bound. 
      Each bell beyond the first results in a -1 modifier to the spellcheck roll for the binding. 
      These clappers must also be encrusted with gold and/or gems worth at least 100gp each. 
      The rituals of binding require a day per bell, along with a Spellburn of CL per bell. 
      Once the ritual has succeeded, no additional bells may be bound to the spirit by the spellcaster.
    manifestation: Ritual Magic. Judge's choice.
    misfire: |
      Loss of materials, including the clapper bones. Incur the ire of the spirit, causing the spirit to haunt the caster for &lt;number of bells attempted&gt;d6 + CL months. 
      Once a week, this spirit may manifest itself in the physical realm, and be seen and heard by anyone. 
      The spellcaster may never use this spell with the spirit, and will likely never get any willing cooperation from the spirit again.
    spellcheck:
      "< 6": Failure. Loss of materials and attributes, including the clapper bones.
      "7-10": Failure. Loss of materials and attributes, but not the clapper bones.
