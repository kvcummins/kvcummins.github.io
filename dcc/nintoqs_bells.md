The spellcaster creates special bells that can bind the spirits of the dead, and compel answers from them using the spell <a href="{{site_url}}/dcc/nintoqs_jingle.html"><em>Nintoq's Compelling Jingle</em></a>. 

The spellcaster creates one to four small bells, the clappers for each being crafted from a bone from the corpse of the spirit being bound. Each bell beyond the first results in a -1 modifier to the spellcheck roll for the binding. These clappers must also be encrusted with gold and/or gems worth at least 100gp each. The rituals of binding require a day per bell, along with a Spellburn of CL per bell. Once the ritual has succeeded, no additional bells may be bound to the spirit by the spellcaster.


Manifestation
 : Ritual Magic. Judge's choice.

<br />
Fumble
 : Loss of materials, including the clapper bones. Incur the ire of the spirit, causing the spirit to haunt the caster for <number of bells attempted>d6 + CL months. Once a week, this spirit may manifest itself in the physical realm, and be seen and heard by anyone. The spellcaster may never use this spell with the spirit.
