### A 0-level funnel

## Steeped in Fear

The common room is full of families and fear. No one wants to be alone these nights, with the mist pouring out of the woods, and the _things_ that have happened. The town dogs are quieted by the eerie howls of something else. Something in the woods. Families gather together even tighter, a child begins to snuffle and cry softly. A mother, whose newborn boy begins to fuss and cry, unceremoniously begins to feed him, knowing that tonight, everyone is family, and there is no need for false modesty. The howl is taken up by another creature from the darkness, and as they get closer to the town, the tension rises in the room. For several indeterminable minutes, there is silence. Then, in a chorus of triumphant glee, the unearthly howls rise in unison. Someone has lost a sheep, or a pig, or a cow. Now there is a release in the room. Fathers order a last round, mothers worry over their children, and everyone shoots looks out through the walls and shuttered windows, as if they could see their modest homes, and could tell if it was their homestead that had been victimized.

With a violent startle, everyone freezes as a howl rises from _just outside the door_! The sound of something large sniffing the doorway, and pawing at the door has people cowering against the back wall of the over-crowded tavern. A muffled command is heard, and the noises stop briefly. But they resume, and the muffled command is repeated, louder and with more of an edge. The snuffling continues for a few seconds, then there is a bowel-loosening growl, and then silence. For a full five minutes, no one moves a muscle. The inkeeper wisely begins handing out the few threadbare blankets he has. No one wants to go outside this night.

Discussions begin about what happened:
"It's into the town, now! Can any of us be safe?" 
"We need to do something!" 
"I'm not facing whatever that is!" 
"We can all face it! Have some faith in yourselves!"

Part panic, part braggadocio, talks swing between taking a pitchfork out in the night and ending the terror, and packing up families and moving to safer environs. Nobody gets much sleep, and as dawn begins to shed its light through the cracks of the shutters, a few of the more experienced hunters step outside. "Tracks look like a wolf, or a dog. Big 'un, but just a wolf." "And a rider, too! I followed them tracks to the edge of town, and there were horse prints, and they were shod. That's a rider for sure."

A makeshift posse is organized, with a surprising number of people willing to see this fear ended. A plan is hatched to gather at a nearby farm the next evening to lie in wait, and get to the bottom of these raids. Those who have volunteered go home to rest and prepare themselves...
