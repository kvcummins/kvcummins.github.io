<h2>Campaign Setting and other Trivia</h2>
In these pages, you'll find all the notes and write ups I create for a campaign for my kids. It's all a WIP, and I hope you can find some nugget of usefulness in here. If you do, please let me know, I'd love to hear about it. If you have an issue or suggestion, I'd love to hear those, too!
