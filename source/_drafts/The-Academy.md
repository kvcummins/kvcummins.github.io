# Nintoq's Teaching Table

It began simply enough. Nintoq wanted to know more, and didn't believe his own master was being wholly forthcoming. So he made contact with a number of other apprentice wizards, and they began to gather in one of the private rooms of _The Grumpy Strumpet_, a dubious inn and flophouse just on the other side of the city walls from the freeport docks. A favorite of smugglers, privateers, and any other seafarers who want to avoid the cost and scrutiny of the city harbormaster, The Grumpy Strumpet is often a chaotic environment that is easy to blend into. And this is what Nintoq and his cabal did, sharing the secrets and knowledge of their masters in hopes of surpassing and supplanting them.
