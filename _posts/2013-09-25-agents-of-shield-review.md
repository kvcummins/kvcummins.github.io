### _The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._

I had to watch it, of course. I couldn't face myself, or my geek peers, if I hadn't. I'll admit, I had my fears. I really wanted to like it, and I know Mr. Whedon has done a number of TV shows I've enjoyed, but could he bring a known franchise to the small screen? From what I saw last night, the answer is an emphatic "yes". It was a fun show to watch, and it had some twists and potential turns that will surely have me back for episode 2.

### "Welcome to level 7"

Don't lie, you were jonesing for Coulson, too. Even as a poorly kept marketing "surprise", it was good to see Phil back and handling things in his usual, understated way. I also really appreciated the ambiguity introduced about his "recouperation" in Tahiti. I hope they hold on to that hole card for a few episodes, or even seasons. There are a myriad of directions that could go, and I look forward to seeing how it is revealed and resolved.

### Pros and Cons

For a pilot, even of a well-known franchise, the minimal exposition was quite refreshing. There was just enough to rough out each character, but not a steaming pile of rancid backstory. Joss certainly went with "Show, don't Tell". And as he often does, he shows just enough of what's beyond the current script to keep you interested, without the blunt instrument of shooting J.R. just to get you to come back.

On the down side, I'm not enthralled by the comic relief. Perhaps when the characters and writing have settled in a little more, we'll have more of an Odd Couple/Mulder & Sculley/House & Wilson vibe, rather than Chip & Dale/Wonder Twins/Jack & Karen. The closing scene, while being a great shout-out to the comic book tradition, irked me a bit. I expect Lola to be back, but I hope they keep it tasteful and don't turn her into the bizarre love child of KIT and the Batmobile. "Deus Ex Automobilis" would be a crying shame, at least if done too soon, or with any regularity.

### See you next week!

This is definitely on the DVR schedule. With a little luck, they will keep the interactions with the film franchise subdued, allowing the plots to take place "off-screen", and with minimal product placement. Even more fun would be for the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to be recognized by the films...

Anyway, the show gets my thumbs up! I hope that the quality continues, and I look forward to many enjoyable evenings.
