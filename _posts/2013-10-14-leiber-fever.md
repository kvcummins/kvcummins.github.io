### I'm a be-Leiber!

Well, a wannabe. I need to get my hands on the Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser books again. I'd like to spend some of my time writing, and I remember loving those stories. Plus, I think short stories would be the way to get into writing.

They'd also help in the RPG sessions I keep thinking about running with my kids. As with most things in my life, I just need to _do  it_.

### Foothurd and the Taupe Rathskeller

I'll have to develop some characters, of course. And a world. And, and, and...

Breathe...

Nothing is going to spring forth, fully formed. Perhaps if I started with some scenes. Some descriptive paragraphs. Try to avoid Lovecraftian prose... Need to find a low-key, informal writing group. Someplace where I can bounce things off people, and see what I've got.

### And now, for something completely different

Need to decide if I'm actually going to build my CNC table. I had created my own design, but I think I'm going to go with a free, but well-received design. I just need to start cutting, drilling, and sanding... Planning to use the [Arduino][] I got for Christmas as the controller. I can feed it G-Code, and it will control the motors. We'll see.
