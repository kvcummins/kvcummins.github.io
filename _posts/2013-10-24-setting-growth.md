### Additional fluff

I've been adding to the fluff for my setting, including more details about [Ruzakath][]. 
At some point soon, I need to map out more of the interior, and provide a slightly less narrative description of the current site.

I have to say that it's a lot more fun to write it up in narrative form than it is to write it as a module.
And I know I have to be careful. I don't want to get so wrapped up in the narrative that I forget to actually _run_ the adventure(s), and I need to be aware that I can change things on the fly.

What do you think about narrative fluff? How much belongs in a module, and how much could/should be available outside of the module? 
Would it be interesting to have a short story, or novella, about the origin story of the locations in the module as a separate item?

### Thoughts on moving forward

I think I'm going to write up at least one monster, based on the discussions in the [Spellburn][] podcast, specifically [Episode 3][] with [Michael Curtis][]...
