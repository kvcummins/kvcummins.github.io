### Just Do It

I was just thinking about how my blog is languishing here, with no new content. I thought about pestering those lazy writers, then remembered that *I* am the lazy writer.

### Some random thoughts

Just had our irrigation system winterized. Need to do the same for the lawn tractor. Specifically, get the snow blade and chains on it. But I'll probably wait, in case we need one more mowing. I just need to get them on before it actually snows, or gets so cold the metal hurts to handle.

Started playing [The Blockheads][] on my phone. Got my kids interested, too. Now I'm just waiting for a windows-based server to be released.

Also been playing [World of Tanks][] on occasion. On the off chance you play, I'm kvcummins. Not the best around, but I'm not a complete waste of a Tier III vehicle.

All that said, I need to get the kids off the computers. They spend too much time on them. I try to get them reading, or something non-electronic, but it's a struggle. I need to suck it up, and play some more RPGs with them. They seem to like [Pathfinder][] and [Edge of the Empire][], although I'd like to try [Dungeon Crawl Classics][] and [FATE][].

### Gaming thoughts

Writing about running the kids in an RPG got me to thinking about how I would do it. Obviously, it depends on the system... 

I love the thought of [DCC][Dungeon Crawl Classics], but I'm afraid the high mortality rate might turn off my son.
I'd have to make sure I pitched it as a gonzo, lethal game, so he knows what to expect.
Might be fun a couple of times. If they really enjoy the funnel, I could run a couple of those...

[FATE][] would also be cool, but I'm not confident I could use compels and invokes properly, much less encourage the kids to.
I think it would be good, given the more descriptive and dramatic style, and I __know__ the kids would appreciate the "yes, and..." style of GM'ing.

Longer term, I would want to create a campaign, or at least a sandbox for them persist in. Probably some variation on a [Hex Crawl][]...
